# JWT Creator

Simple webapp that converts an existing private or public key into a [JSON Web
Key (JWK)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).

Why does this exist? Because I couldn't find an online tool that did what I
wanted. There are a few others but they generate the private key and create the
JWK from that. Not what I wanted.
